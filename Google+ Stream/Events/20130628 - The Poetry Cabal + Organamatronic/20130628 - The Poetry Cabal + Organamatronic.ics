SUMMARY:The Poetry Cabal + Organamatronic
DESCRIPTION:The strange yet beautiful wonder which is poets and musicians making art together is happening again, June 28th upstairs at Red Rock Coffee in downtown Mountain View.<br /><br />Organamatronic makes improvised music out of a bewildering variety of instruments and devices, creating entire civilizations of sound.<br /><br />The Poetry Cabal is a collection of poets who, for months at a time, meet only in basement rooms of hidden mansions, but emerge occasionally to question existence and demand answers
